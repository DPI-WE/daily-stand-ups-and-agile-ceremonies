# Daily Stand-ups and Agile Ceremonies ðŸŒŸ
In this lesson, you will learn about daily stand-ups and other common agile ceremonies such as retrospectives, one-on-ones, and planning sessions. These ceremonies are crucial for maintaining effective communication, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the smooth progress of projects within agile teams.

## Daily Stand-ups

### What Are Daily Stand-ups?
Daily stand-ups are a very common practice on agile development teams. They are quick meetings â€” typically 10 minutes or less â€” for the entire team to check in with each other. The name "stand-up" comes from the idea that the meeting should be short enough that everyone can stand for its duration.

### Purpose of Daily Stand-ups
The main objectives of daily stand-ups are:

- **Share Progress**: Team members briefly describe what they worked on yesterday.
- **Plan for the Day**: Team members explain what they are working on today.
- **Identify Blockers**: Team members highlight any issues blocking their progress.

### Format of Daily Stand-ups
During the stand-up, each team member answers three key questions:

- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Is anything blocking you?

It's okay to "pass" if what you did is completely irrelevant to the team (e.g., you took your dog to the vet). The key part is identifying blockers to find ways to get unblocked, either by seeking expertise or informing others that they are causing a block.

## Overcoming Discomfort
Sharing your work status can feel intimidating, especially if you are behind or ahead. It's natural to feel self-conscious, but it's important to overcome this reflex. On a healthy team, transparency is key, and there's no judgment, only support.

### Best Practices
- **Keep it short**: Less than 1 minute per person.
- **Be specific**: Avoid vague statements like "Ruby stuff yesterday, more Ruby stuff today." Instead, provide concrete details or pass if not relevant.
- **Share "Aha!" moments**: Even if you don't have blockers, share any insights or breakthroughs you experienced.

We will be doing stand-ups every day at 9:15 AM. **Spend some time preparing for stand-ups by writing down your three key points.**

## Other Agile Ceremonies
### Retrospectives
- **When**: Typically at the end of each sprint (often on Fridays).
- **Purpose**: Reflect on the sprint to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.
- **Format**: Team members share:

What went well?
What didn't go well?
What can we improve for the next sprint?
Shoutouts

We will be doing retrospectives every Friday at 9 AM. **Spend some time preparing for retrospectives by writing down your thoughts on what went well (or poorly) and what we can improve on for next week.**

### One-on-Ones
- **When**: Scheduled regularly, often quarterly or monthly.
- **Purpose**: Provide a private space for individual team members to discuss their progress, challenges, and career development with their manager or team lead.
- **Format**: Open-ended discussions focusing on:
  - Individual progress and achievements.
  - Personal challenges or concerns.
  - Career goals and development.

## Planning Sessions
- When: At the beginning of each sprint.
- Purpose: Define the work to be completed in the upcoming sprint and set priorities.
- Format: Team reviews the backlog, selects items to work on, and assigns tasks. Key activities include:

  - Reviewing backlog items.
  - Estimating effort and complexity.
  - Prioritizing tasks.
  - Assigning tasks to team members.
